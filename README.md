# EthernetSimulator
Simulates data packet transmission between two nodes over ethernet using the TCP communication protocol.
---
## Simulator Implementation
- Uses two nodes to simulate data packet transmission. i.e. send and receive.
- Emphasis on implementation of TCP protocol.
- Basic version assumes no packet loss or transmission delays.
- Uses C++ for the core implementation.
